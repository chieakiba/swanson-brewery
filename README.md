##Ron Swanson Brewery Recommendation
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
For the front-end, this project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React-Redux. For the backend, this project uses ExpressJS and NodeJS. Ron Swanson quotes are courtesy of (put the link and name of github repo). Maps are obviously from Google Maps API.

IMPORTANT: I do not own Ron Swanson or his character. I just thought it was fun to have his character recommend beers with his words of wisdom.
